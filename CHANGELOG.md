# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [4.1.1] - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- CICD: skip the sourcemap when diffing dist. Streaming its diff to the job log dominated
  the Validate dist step, pushing the build job to nearly ten minutes on a stale-bundle failure.
- Build: rebuild dist for undici 6.28.0. Dependabot only updates package-lock.json,
  but undici is a runtime dependency that rollup inlines into the committed bundle.
- Editorial: Use Dash0 endpoints in README examples.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Added the `otlpInsecureSkipVerify` input for exporting to trusted internal OTLP endpoints whose
  TLS certificates cannot be verified.
  Thanks @OneCyrus!

### Changed

- Span status now follows the OpenTelemetry
  [recording-errors](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/recording-errors/)
  conventions: it is set to `Error` (with the standard `error.type` attribute) for the
  `failure`, `timed_out`, and `startup_failure` conclusions, and left unset otherwise
  (previously it was set to `Ok` on success and `Error` only for `failure`).
- **Removed** the non-standard boolean `error` attribute from workflow, job, and step spans.
  Use the span status or the `error.type` attribute instead.
- The `github.job.labels` attribute is now exported as an array of strings instead of a
  comma-separated string, consistent with the PR label attributes.

- The repository was transferred from `corentinmusard/otel-cicd-action` to
  [`dash0hq/otel-cicd-action`](https://github.com/dash0hq/otel-cicd-action) and is now maintained
  by [Dash0](https://www.dash0.com). Existing `uses: corentinmusard/otel-cicd-action@v4` references
  keep working via GitHub's redirect, but updating to `dash0hq/otel-cicd-action@v4` is recommended.
